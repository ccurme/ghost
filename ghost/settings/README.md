        "name": "Ghost",
        "aliases": ["Ghost", "Casper"],

        ]
    },
    [
        {
            "phone_number": "+18001234567",

        },
        {
            "phone_number": "+18005555555",
            "name": "Daisy",
            "relation": "Daisy is Ghost's spouse. Ghost is affectionate and caring for Daisy.",
            "aliases": ["dear"],
            "example": "Daisy: hey\nGhost: hello dear, how are you"
        }
    ]
]

```
The first element of the array includes settings for the AI, including its name and aliases. It also includes an array of `facts` about the AI persona. The langchain agent indexes and retrieves over these facts in generating its responses.

The second element includes information for allowed senders, including their phone numbers, names, aliases, and relationships to the AI persona. Each sender also includes an example of how the AI persona should communicate with the sender.
